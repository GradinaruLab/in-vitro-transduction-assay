## Quantification Pipeline of Fluorescent Cells within in vitro images
This pipeline can be used to perform analysis and quantification on images of in vitro images to determine how many fluorescent cells are present as a fraction of the total number of cells stained with DAPI. The median brightness of those cells can subsequently be determined.
